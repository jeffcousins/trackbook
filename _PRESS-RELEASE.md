There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > TrackBook

## Sub-Heading ##
  > An iOS app that helps you keep track of the books you've read.

## Summary ##
  > If you have a bookshelf, then there's a good chance you own a ton of books. However, you probably have either read other books you don't own, read a few online, or even listened to some in audiobook format. The collection on your shelf is not a true representation of all the text you've read. With TrackBook, you have a quick reference to all the knowledge and stories you've encountered.

## Problem ##
  > Can you tell me the titles of all the books you've ever read? If not, you need TrackBook for your mobile device.

## Solution ##
  > Hey! Now you can show me all the books you've read! Let's discuss your favorites over coffee.

## Quote from You ##
  > "Read moar!" -Jeff Cousins

## How to Get Started ##
  > Download the app from Apple's App Store. Log in with your GitHub username, search for a book, and tap it to add it to your collection. It's that easy.

## Customer Quote ##
  > "My goal this year was to read twenty-four new books. TrackBook helped me keep track of them all and allowed me to search for new books by my favorite authors." _-Wise man_

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Get TrackBook on your iPhone!
