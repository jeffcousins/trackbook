# TrackBook #

#### An iOS app that helps you keep track of the books you've read. ####

Built with React Native.
This was a two-day solo MVP project.

### What does it do for me? ###
  If you have a bookshelf, then there's a good chance you own a ton of books. However, you probably have either read other books you don't own, read a few online, or even listened to some in audiobook format. The collection on your shelf is not a true representation of all the text you've read. With TrackBook, you have a quick reference to all the knowledge and stories you've encountered.

#### Should I get it? ####
  Can you tell me the titles of all the books you've ever read? If not, you need TrackBook for your mobile device.

#### I just downloaded it and tried it out. Now what? ####
  Hey! Now you can show me all the books you've read! Let's discuss your favorites over coffee.

## How to Get Started ##
  Download the app from Apple's App Store. Log in with your GitHub username, search for a book, and tap it to add it to your collection. It's that easy.
